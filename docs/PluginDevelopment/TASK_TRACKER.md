## Dependencies & Blockers

### Critical Dependencies
1. **NetBox API Access** - Required for all integration features
2. **Database Schema Updates** - Must be completed before UI work
3. **WebSocket Server Updates** - Needed for version management

### Current Blockers
- None! Sites dropdown is finally working!

### Risk Items
1. **Performance with Large Diagrams** - May need optimization
2. **WebSocket Stability** - Requires robust reconnection logic
3. **Browser Compatibility** - Need cross-browser testing
4. **Draw.io Integration** - PostMessage API is unreliable, may need alternative approach
5. **Data Loss Risk** - Users might forget to click "Save Current" button

## Notes & Decisions

### Key Decisions Made
- Use Vercel-style deployment model for clarity
- Prioritize version management over advanced features
- Keep one LIVE diagram per site constraint
- Use sidebar instead of popups for better UX
- **Sync NetBox data to ArchiFlow DB first** (don't query NetBox directly)

### Open Questions
- Should we support branching/merging of diagrams?
- How to handle very large sites with many devices?
- Should device images be shared across sites?
- What level of NetBox permissions to require?

### Lessons Learned
- **Tom Select interference**: NetBox uses Tom Select for dropdowns, must destroy it before updating
- **Data flow pattern**: NetBox â†’ ArchiFlow DB â†’ Frontend (documented in SITES_DROPDOWN_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- **WebSocket timing**: Need delays and fallbacks for WebSocket connection
- **Simple is better**: Basic HTML select works better than fancy libraries
- **Draw.io Storage Conflict**: Cannot fully disable Draw.io local storage, need explicit save to DB
- **PostMessage Limitations**: Draw.io iframe communication is limited and poorly documented
- **Version Isolation**: Each diagram version must have its own diagram_data in database
